I'm excited to present the first version of my new personal website!

I built this website using [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/), with the new App Router architecture. Other tools I used include [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [Bright](https://github.com/code-hike/bright). I'm hosting it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I hope to post more about the process of building this website soon. In the meantime, you can check out the [source code](https://github.com/nebrelbug/bengubler.com).

I'm grateful for the official NextJS docs and [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app), which I used heavily; [this fantastic blog post by Max Leiter](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13#sitemap-support-sitemapjs), about using the new App Router architecture; and the [Precedent theme](https://precedent.dev/), from which I borrowed my header component.
